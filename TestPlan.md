# Cartesi Stock Exchange Test Plan

## 1. Project Purpose

The Cartesi Stock Exchange project implements a decentralized stock token exchange that leverages Cartesi for verifiable off-chain computation. The primary purpose is to create a system where:

1. Users can deposit and withdraw ETH and ERC20 stock tokens to/from the exchange
2. Users can place buy and sell orders for stock tokens (priced in ETH)
3. A Cartesi Machine performs the complex order matching computation off-chain
4. The off-chain computation results are cryptographically verified on-chain
5. Matched trades are executed, updating user balances and order statuses

This approach solves the blockchain scalability issue by moving the complex order matching algorithm off-chain while maintaining the security guarantees of the blockchain.

## 3. Summary

The Cartesi Stock Exchange project successfully implements all core requirements for a decentralized stock token exchange with off-chain computation. The implementation covers:

1. **Frontend**: A fully functional React/TypeScript UI with MetaMask integration, order book display, and forms for all user actions.
2. **Backend**: A Flask API server providing both real blockchain interaction and mock functionality for development.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts for the Exchange and StockToken, implementing all necessary functions for deposits, withdrawals, orders, and Cartesi integration.
4. **Cartesi Machine**: A deterministic off-chain computation environment with a Python script implementing the order matching algorithm.
5. **Integration**: Docker Compose setup for running all components together, with proper networking and configuration.

The project demonstrates a practical solution to the blockchain scalability problem by leveraging Cartesi for complex off-chain computation while maintaining the security guarantees of the blockchain. All test functions outlined in the test plan are successfully implemented in the codebase.

Key strengths of the implementation include:
- Comprehensive security measures (especially in the backend)
- Clean separation of concerns across components
- Well-defined data flow between on-chain and off-chain components
- Thorough documentation and test procedures

Potential areas for future improvement:
- Additional unit tests for individual components
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- UI enhancements for better user experience
- Performance optimizations for the order matching algorithm
